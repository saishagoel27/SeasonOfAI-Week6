Project 5 Overview

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) inspired by the groundbreaking research paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Radford et al. (2015). The paper introduced a novel architecture for GANs, leveraging deep convolutional and transposed convolutional layers to generate high-quality images.

Implementation

The implementation closely follows the DCGAN architecture, comprising:

Generator:
Takes random noise as input.
Generates realistic images through a series of transposed convolutional layers.
Aims to deceive the discriminator.

Discriminator:
Receives both real and fake images.
Classifies images as real or fake using convolutional layers.
Aims to accurately distinguish between real and fake images.
Training Process

Generate Fake Images: The generator creates a batch of fake images.

Discriminate: The discriminator evaluates both real and fake images.

Train the Models:

The discriminator is trained to correctly classify real and fake images.

The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, making its fake images more realistic.

Iterate: The process is repeated iteratively, with the generator and discriminator improving over time.
